The project aimed to deliver a rich and versatile user experience, capable of handling video and voice conversations, while dynamically integrating interactive widgets based on user requests. Depending on the conversation, the chatbot can display product recommendations, movie details, travel information, and more — creating a highly complete and responsive interaction flow.",

      "This project was built using React.js, with Framer Motion handling all the animation work. It was my first time using Framer Motion in a professional context, and it integrated seamlessly with React's declarative syntax. I chose it specifically for its ability to manage page transitions and element animations in a clean, expressive way. The library's tight integration with React made it easy to maintain smooth, state-driven animations across the site.",
      "One of the main challenges of the project was managing background video playback across devices. The animation was split into two distinct phases: an intro sequence and a seamless transition into a looping animation. We also had to provide separate versions for desktop and mobile to maintain visual quality and performance. On top of that, mobile devices required additional logic to handle cases like low battery mode, where autoplay is restricted. Orchestrating all of this took more time than expected, but it taught me a lot about handling video with precision in production environments.",
